    "My name is Travis Waith-Mair and I'm an excited and energetic Web Developer, currently working just outside of Salt Lake City, UT. Outside of my day job, I enjoy building and maintaining open source projects, freelance work, and hand out my kids at home.  I love Javascript and especially React.js.  Outside of web development, I love all things nerdy.  I often can be found debating Star Wars, super heroes, and most anything else nerdy.   I have learned to speak Thai, and some Spanish and Esperanto.  I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Web Development, and driven to learn and understand new technologies, implement fundamental design principles, and write reliable, well-tested, reusable code.",

Outside of web development, I love all things nerdy.  I often can be found debating Star Wars, super heroes, and most anything else nerdy.   I have learned to speak Thai, and some Spanish and Esperanto.  I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques.
